# Cybersecurity-Project-Journey-Defensive-Engineering-Portfolio
This repository documents my journey building enterprise-grade defensive security labs &amp; tools, each captured in a dedicated project repository. Unlike offensive security tooling, every project here focuses on detection, hardening, automation &amp; compliance - the critical foundations of a modern Blue Team, DevSecOps practice, and enterprise defense.
