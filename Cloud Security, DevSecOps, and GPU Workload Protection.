I documented this project blueprint to walk my audience through it step-by-step. No assumptions: what to install, where to run things, why they matter, and a short story of how the pieces work together in a real company. I’ll also make it crystal clear **who** (DevOps, SecOps, developer) should run each piece and **how** each gives enterprise value.

They’re DevSecOps + SecOps tools — a hybrid.

* **DevSecOps**: `python-compliance-automation` and the k8s manifest checks are aimed at pipelines and infra-as-code (DevOps teams with security responsibilities).
* **SecOps / SOC**: `siem-log-analysis-toolkit` and `pdf-malware-defense` are primarily for SOC analysts and endpoint/email security teams.
* **The GPU lab** sits at the intersection: infra/dev teams will build/run it; security engineers design the hardening and mitigation controls.

---

# What to download first (ABC — minimal, safe list)

Install these on your workstation or lab VM:

A. Basic tools

* **Git** (to clone repos)
* **Python 3.10+** and `pip`
* **VS Code** (or any editor)

B. Containers & Kubernetes

* **Docker Desktop** (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine on Linux
* **kubectl** (Kubernetes CLI)
* **minikube** or **kind** (local K8s cluster for lab) — use minikube if you want a simple UI
* (Optional for real GPUs) **NVIDIA drivers** + **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** / `nvidia-docker2`

C. Cloud & SIEM tools

* **AWS CLI** + credentials (for cloud checks)
* **Splunk** (free trial or Splunk Light / Splunk Dev environment) or ELK (Elastic) if preferred

D. Misc

* `pip install` these Python libs: `PyPDF2`, `pynvml` (for GPU), `boto3` (AWS), `requests`, `pyyaml`

# This is the step-by-step, project by project — with exact commands & where to run

---

## 1) GPU Cloud Security Lab — "simulate and harden GPU workloads"

**Who runs it:** SecEng / infra engineers, DevOps
**Where to run:** local lab (minikube/kind) *or* cloud GPU instance (AWS EC2 GPU) for full CUDA checks

### Why it matters

It demonstrates how GPU workloads can be isolated so tenants don’t escape or leak data — very important for platforms like Runpod.

### Setup (ABC)

A. If you have no GPU hardware (local dev only):

1. Install Docker, kubectl, and minikube.
2. Create a minikube cluster:

   ```
   minikube start --driver=docker
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
3. Deploy namespace & K8s manifests:

   ```
   git clone <your-github>/gpu-cloud-security-lab
   cd gpu-cloud-security-lab/k8s
   kubectl apply -f namespace-isolation.yaml
   kubectl apply -f gpu-workload-deployment.yaml
   ```

   *Note:* This workload will run even without a GPU (it won't access GPU), but you can still test seccomp/AppArmor and network policies.

B. If you have access to a GPU node (recommended for CUDA checks):

1. Spin up a GPU VM in the cloud (AWS g4dn/g5, GCP A2), install NVIDIA drivers and Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
2. Deploy a k8s cluster or EKS nodegroup with GPU nodes; then apply the same manifests.
3. Run the CUDA inspector:

   ```
   pip install nvidia-ml-py3
   python3 cuda-research/cuda-memory-check.py
   ```

   This tells you GPU presence and memory usage — a first step for monitoring isolation.

### How to make it production-useful

* Add `tools/k8s_hardening_check.py` into GitHub Actions to run on PRs that change K8s YAML — prevents risky configs from reaching production.
* Run a **DaemonSet** or CronJob that periodically runs CUDA checks and pushes metrics to Prometheus → alert on anomalies.

## 2) Python Compliance Automation — "automate audit evidence & checks"

**Who runs it:** DevSecOps, Cloud Security Engineer
**Where to run:** CI (GitHub Actions) or as scheduled job (nightly) in a secure environment

### Why it matters

Since Auditors want repeatable evidence. Automating IAM & S3 checks and producing JSON reports saves hours during audits (SOC 2 / ISO 27001).

### Setup (ABC)

1. Install Python requirements:

   ```
   git clone <your>/python-compliance-automation
   cd python-compliance-automation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. I Configure AWS credentials (use a read-only auditor role/keys stored in CI secrets).
3. Run locally for a quick proof:

   ```
   python3 run_checks.py --out reports/report.json
   ```

   Output: `reports/report.json` — a timestamped file you can present to auditors.

### CI integration (example)

* I Add a GitHub Action that runs nightly and uploads the report to an S3 bucket or stores it as a build artifact. On finding an over-privileged IAM user, the pipeline can open a Jira ticket automatically.

## 3) PDF Malware Defense — "detect malicious PDFs before users open them"

**Who runs it:** SOC analysts, Endpoint/Email security team
**Where to run:** workstation/service that handles inbound attachments (mail gateway) or endpoint watchers for high-risk teams

### Why it matters

Malicious PDFs are a common initial access vector. Automating detection prevents user interaction with malicious content.

### Setup (ABC)

1. Install code:

   ```
   git clone <your>/pdf-malware-defense
   cd pdf-malware-defense
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Single-file scan (test):

   ```
   python3 scanner/pdf_analyze.py examples/sample.pdf
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
     "has_javascript": true,
     "has_openaction": false,
     "embedded_files": ["payload.exe"]
   }
   ```
3. Monitor mode (run as a background service):

   * Option 1: Systemd unit (Linux) that runs `pdf_monitor.py` on startup and scans `/home/you/Downloads`.
   * Option 2: Integrate into mail server: pipe attachments to `pdf_analyze.py` and drop or quarantine if suspicious.

### Production integration

* Use Splunk/ELK to receive the JSON events produced by the scanner (HTTP Event Collector / syslog). SOC gets an alert and full file metadata for triage.

---

## 4) SIEM Log Analysis Toolkit — "turn logs into precise detections"

**Who runs it:** SOC analysts, threat hunters
**Where to run:** local testing, ingestion pipelines (Logstash/Fluentd), or inside Splunk/ELK

### Why this matters

Raw logs are noisy. Good parsers + detection templates reduce false positives and speed up triage.

### Setup (ABC)

1. Pull the repo:

   ```
   git clone <your>/siem-log-analysis-toolkit
   cd siem-log-analysis-toolkit
   ```
2. Parse sample logs locally:

   ```
   python3 parsers/ssh_parser.py tests/sample_logs/auth.log > parsed.json
   ```

   Parsed events are JSON-ready for SIEM ingestion.
3. Import detection templates:

   * In Splunk, create correlation searches using `detections/suspicious_kerberos.json` as a starting point.
   * Tune thresholds and add whitelists.

### How SOC uses it

* Parsers run as pre-processing on ingest to normalize fields (username, source IP, geo).
* Detection templates fire alerts that map to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, making incident classification consistent.

# Enterprise Day-to-Day Storytelling: “A Day in the Life” — how the pieces work together

Imagine you’re a Jr. SOC Analyst at **CloudAI Inc.** — they run GPU cloud workloads and care about compliance.

**Morning (08:15)**

* You open Splunk. Overnight the `pdf-malware-defense` scanned 20 inbound PDFs; 2 flagged `has_javascript=true`. You see the JSON alert in Splunk with file names and source email. You quarantine the emails and start triage.

**09:00 — Triage**

* You use `pdf_analyze.py` locally to re-scan the quarantined files and confirm malicious indicators. You attach the JSON report to a Jira ticket and notify the Incident Response owner. The PDF scanner logged everything to SIEM, so the threat hunter traces similar attachments across the corp.

**10:30 — IaC PR review**

* A DevOps PR modified a Kubernetes manifest. The repo runs `k8s_hardening_check.py` in GitHub Actions. The pipeline failed the PR because `hostNetwork: true` was added. You (or the infra engineer) comment on the PR and request changes — this prevented a potential host-level exposure.

**14:00 — GPU cluster monitoring**

* The GPU DaemonSet reported abnormal VRAM usage on node `gpu-02`. The CUDA inspector script showed a tenant process leaking memory. You raised a ticket: infra puts the pod into maintenance, and the engineering team applies a cgroup limit to protect co-tenants.

**16:00 — Compliance update**

* The nightly `python-compliance-automation` job produced `reports/report.json` and uploaded it to the secure auditor bucket. The audit manager now has fresh evidence for SOC 2 controls — no manual evidence emails required.

**End of day**

* You update the SOC playbook documenting a new detection rule (from the PDF scanner) and note the steps for containment and evidence export. Everything is tracked and repeatable.
